1. A form of 10 fields including username, password, at least one date field, one file upload field and at least one description field.
2. A data grid to display records submitted from the form. You can populate the records directly in the grid (at least 100 records) and are not required to connect the form and grid with the database in real. However, if you can do that, it would be great.
3. Grid should show 5 of the fields by default + icons of delete, edit, notes, tags & expand.
4. Remaining 5 fields should be visible on click of an expand icon for each of the records.
5. Edit should open an edit form (database connectivity is not mandatory) and delete should remove the record from the grid after seeking a confirmation from the user.
6. Also show a column of Tags, where tags can be created and assigned to any of the records. Tags created to be assigned to one record should be available to be assigned to others too. So each tag should be created once only.
7. The click of Notes icon will allow the user to enter the descriptive note specific to that record.
8. Users can customize the grid and decide which 5 fields they want to see in the grid by default.
9. Create a search field. Search should look for the query in all 10 fields (except password and attachment), tags and notes.
